Education
======
* Ph.D in Sichuan University, 2023
* B.S. in Sichuan University, 2019

Research experience
======
* 2019-2023: Key Technologies and Demonstration Applications of Market Consumption and Dispatching Control of CSP-Photovoltaic-Wind Power New Energy Base
  * Proposed a dynamic model for CSP systems and constructed an integrated simulation platform
  * Analyzed the influencing factors and mechanisms of trip-off failures in renewable energy systems
  * Analyzed the impact of varying proportions of CSP on trip-off failures in renewable energy systems
  * Participated in the research on coordinating CSP with other energy sources to mitigate trip-off failures in renewable energy systems


* 2019-2021: The Research on Sensitive Industrial Process Failure Mechanism and Tolerance Capacity under Voltage Sag
  * Conducted a study on the impact patterns of multidimensional features, such as amplitude and duration of voltage sags, on typical sensitive devices like AC contactors
  * Participated in the research on the impact patterns and mapping mechanisms of process failures caused by equipment malfunctions
  * Proposes an adaptive tripping scheme for AC contactors to improve the motor immunity to voltage sags


* 2021-2024: Research on Load Flexibility Assessment for Multi-user by Considering the Coupling between Heterogeneous Devices
